Quick exercise in BFS/Dijkstra and A*.

The Manhatten distance heuristic is very nice because it ends up with fewer turns and squiggles as opposed to using the hypotenuse (though it tends to be less accurate, as you can see in the picture below).

Credit to gyre on SO for the priority queue implementation.
